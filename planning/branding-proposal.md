# Branding Proposal: .app & .me Edition 🚀

Since `.ai` domains are expensive (~$70-$100/yr), switching to `.app` or `.me` is a great move. These are much more affordable (~$15-$20/yr) and perfect for a goal tracker.

Here are the names that flow best with these extensions.

---

## 📱 The ".app" Collection (Action-Oriented)
The `.app` extension tells the user exactly what it is—a tool for productivity. These names sound sharp, fast, and functional.

### Bird-Themed 🐦
1.  **Swift.app** (Clean, fast, high-performance)
2.  **Lark.app** (The "Early Bird" tool for starting your day/goals)
3.  **Volo.app** (Latin for "I fly" - very premium sounding)
4.  **Finch.app** (Small, active, and friendly)
5.  **Pitta.app** (Short, symmetrical, and modern)
6.  **Weka.app** (Sounds like "Work" or "Wake"—pure productivity)
7.  **Zena.app** (Short for Zenaida; sleek and sophisticated)

### Action-Themed 🚀
8.  **Aimly.app** (Friendly, focused, and intuitive)
9.  **Ascent.app** (The tool for your upward journey)
10. **Propel.app** (Action-oriented and powerful)
11. **Orbit.app** (Keeping your life and goals in sync)
12. **Velo.app** (Short for Velocity—fast progress)

## � The ".me" Collection (Personalized & Companion)
The `.me` extension makes the app feel like a personal coach or a digital identity. It's much more intimate and "human."

### Bird-Themed 🐦
1.  **Robin.me** (The classic helper bird; feels like a person)
2.  **Lark.me** (My personal morning/goal routine)
3.  **Wren.me** (Small bird, big impact; feels very personal)
4.  **Pipit.me** (Short, rhythmic, and cute)
5.  **Sora.me** (Means "Sky" - expansive and personal)
6.  **Avis.me** ("Bird Me" in Latin - unique and brandable)

### Mindset-Themed 🧠
7.  **Zeno.me** (Logic, steps, and personal philosphy)
8.  **Volo.me** ("I wish" / "I want"—perfect for goals)
9.  **Koda.me** (Sounds like a personal buddy or assistant)
10. **Zoe.me** (Means "Life"—living your best life)
11. **Path.me** (Your personal roadmap)

## 🎯 Pro-Tip: The "Verb" Combo
If the single bird name is taken on `.app` or `.me`, these "Verb + Name" combos are almost always available and very catchy:

- **FlyWith.me**
- **TrackWith.me**
- **PlanWith.me**
- **Go[Bird].app** (e.g., `GoSwift.app`)
- **Get[Bird].app** (e.g., `GetLark.app`)

**Which extension do you prefer?** Once you decide, we can lock in the name and update the app's metadata!
